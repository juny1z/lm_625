# lm625: Fast Linear Regression via Matrix Computations

The **lm625** package provides a lightweight and efficient implementation of linear regression using the closed-form OLS solution:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^\top X)^{-1} X^\top y.
$$

The main function, `fast_lm()`, replicates the interface of R's base `lm()` and supports both:

-   **formula interface**, e.g. `fast_lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = dat)`
-   **x–y interface**, e.g. `fast_lm(X, y)`

The function is designed primarily for learning purposes and demonstration of core matrix algebra behind linear regression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation

Since this is a course project package, install from local source:

``` r
devtools::install()
```

# Example

Below is a minimal example illustrating basic usage.

``` r
library(lm625)

set.seed(1)
n  <- 100
x1 <- rnorm(n)
x2 <- rnorm(n)
y  <- 1 + 2 * x1 - 3 * x2 + rnorm(n)
dat <- data.frame(y, x1, x2)

# fit using fast_lm
fit_fast <- fast_lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = dat)

# fit using base R lm()
fit_lm <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = dat)

# Compare coefficients
fit_fast$coefficients
coef(fit_lm)

all.equal(fit_fast$coefficients, coef(fit_lm))
```

The coefficients from fast_lm() and lm() agree up to numerical precision, illustrating that the matrix-based implementation is correct.

# Why fast_lm?

The goal of this package is to provide:

A transparent implementation of OLS using matrix operations.

A drop-in replacement for lm() for linear models without additional features.

A pedagogical tool for understanding how linear regression is computed internally.

It also supports the basic components of a model object:

coefficients

fitted values

residuals

design matrix

call

summary method

# Comparison with lm()

To demonstrate correctness, we compare estimated coefficients:

``` r
all.equal(fast_lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = dat)$coefficients,
          coef(lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = dat)))
```

For moderate-size datasets, fast_lm() runs efficiently by leveraging crossprod() and direct matrix operations.

A more complete comparison, including timing benchmarks, is provided in the package vignette:

``` r
vignette("fastlm")
```
